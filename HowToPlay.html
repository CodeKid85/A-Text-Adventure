      Logging Off is a Mystery game where you must solve a mystery. The gameplay is really simple, as the genre is IF, or interactive fiction. Once you click "Play game" (accesable in the menu), just read the incoming text (grey), and choose a response from the buttons on the right (blue). Once you have made your decision, click with the left mouse button on the text that you want to select. Once you select the button, there will be a new incoming text for you to read. Repeat these steps until you complete the game.<br />
      <br />Remember, Always have fun!
